Short description of project:
This is the first mandatory assignment for the class of Web Programming at OsloMet (DATA1700).
It is a web application for buying movie tickets. The application validates the input of which movie, number of tickets,first name, last name, email and phone number. The latter 4 are validated using regex for correct format.
If the input is correct, the input values are stored in an array and displayed on the webpage. I found it quite difficult to work out how the javascript functions should work at first, but after discussing with TA's and other students, the process became easier. However i still have one problem left that i didn't mangage to solve. When there is more than one input with the wrong format, the error message does not go away unless all the faulty inputs have been corrected. Tried to fix this by using an onchange-function, but with no luck. 
When scouting for information on how to solve the assignment, i have used w3schools, regexr.com, youtube and stackoverflow and reddit forums. ChatGPT turned out to be quite useless for this purpose, so i have refrained from using it.
